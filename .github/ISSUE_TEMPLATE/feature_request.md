**Proposal/Summary**
Describe the feature/solution you'd like to see or idea you have.

**Rationale**
Why would this be nice/helpful/worthwhile?

**Implementation**
(Optional) Normally, you are supposed to avoid worrying about implementation details when writing a feature request. However, since this is likely a discussion between developers, we leave this option open. NOTE: What we are primarily looking for with this section is if the suggester has prior experience implementing this feature and has some idea about which approaches does or doesnt work. Known pitfalls or gotchas commonly encountered during implementation should be included here. Please avoid idle speculation.
If you don't have something specific in mind or don't know, just leave this blank and we'll figure out the details.

**Criteria for success/Definition of done**
What criteria/Features/goal MUST an implementation meet, in order to be considered successful (or correct)?
If this line is fuzzy or difficult to pin down, it may help approaching it from the other direction: What are some examples of an implementation or feature that falls short of what you are looking for?
